## My process
- I started by first creating the html document and classes, after which I style the document to look like I wanted.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
I learnt how to easily style a card and position it as desired using css flex property

```html
<div class="container"> the main card goes here</div>
```
```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  flex-wrap:wrap;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development
- I would like to known more about card designs and order cool css design that can make our work standout.
  and also when posting or releasing git you have to go to setting in the particuler repository, then pages and point to the main branch to post and save settings and also name the index file to display in a .md formate else the readme file will be what will be dispalyed.

### Useful resources

- alway check w3school or css tricks for anything confusing, they help alot.
